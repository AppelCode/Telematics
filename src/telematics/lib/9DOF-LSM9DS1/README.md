## SparkFun LSM9DS1 Particle Library

Firmware library SparkFun's Photon IMU Shield and the LSM9DS1 Breakout.

About
-------------------

This is a firmware library for [SparkFun's Photon IMU Shield](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13629).

[![Photon IMU Shield](https://cdn.sparkfun.com//assets/parts/1/1/0/1/6/13629-01a.jpg)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13629).

The Photon IMU Shield connects the Photon WiFi development board up to an [ST LSM9DS1](http://www.st.com/web/catalog/sense_power/FM89/SC1448/PF259998) 9DOF IMU - providing it access to an accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer.

Example Usage
-------------------

#### Initializing the Library

Include the library, declare an IMU object, and set it up with these snippets of code:

	#include "SparkFunLSM9DS1/SparkFunLSM9DS1.h"

	// Use the LSM9DS1 class to create an object. [imu] can be
	// named anything, we'll refer to that throught the sketch.
	LSM9DS1 imu;

	// SDO_XM and SDO_G are both pulled high, so our addresses are:
	#define LSM9DS1_M	0x1E // Would be 0x1C if SDO_M is LOW
	#define LSM9DS1_AG	0x6B // Would be 0x6A if SDO_AG is LOW

	void setup() 
	{
	  Serial.begin(115200);
	  
	  // Before initializing the IMU, there are a few settings
	  // we may need to adjust. Use the settings struct to set
	  // the device's communication mode and addresses:
	  imu.settings.device.commInterface = IMU_MODE_I2C;
	  imu.settings.device.mAddress = LSM9DS1_M;
	  imu.settings.device.agAddress = LSM9DS1_AG;
	  // The above lines will only take effect AFTER calling
	  // imu.begin(), which verifies communication with the IMU
	  // and turns it on.
	  if (!imu.begin())
	  {
		Serial.println("Failed to communicate with LSM9DS1.");
		Serial.println("Double-check wiring.");
		Serial.println("Default settings in this sketch will " \
					  "work for an out of the box LSM9DS1 " \
					  "Breakout, but may need to be modified " \
					  "if the board jumpers are.");
		while (1)
		  ;
	  }
	}

#### Reading Sensor Data

To get data out of the IMU, call `imu.readAccel()`, `imu.readGyro()`, and `imu.readMag()`. Those functions will update the objects member variables: `imu.ax`, `imu.ay`, `imu.az`, `imu.gx`, `imu.gy`, `imu.gz`, `imu.mx`, `imu.my`, and`imu.mz`. Here, some example functions can probably make it more clear:

	void printAccel()
	{
	  // To read from the accelerometer, you must first call the
	  // readAccel() function. When this exits, it'll update the
	  // ax, ay, and az variables with the most current data.
	  imu.readAccel();
	  
	  // Now we can use the ax, ay, and az variables as we please.
	  Serial.print("A: ");
	  Serial.print(imu.ax);
	  Serial.print(", ");
	  Serial.print(imu.ay);
	  Serial.print(", ");
	  Serial.println(imu.az);
	}

	void printGyro()
	{
	  // To read from the gyroscope, you must first call the
	  // readGyro() function. When this exits, it'll update the
	  // gx, gy, and gz variables with the most current data.
	  imu.readGyro();
	  
	  // Now we can use the gx, gy, and gz variables as we please.
	  Serial.print("G: ");
	  Serial.print(imu.gx);
	  Serial.print(", ");
	  Serial.print(imu.gy);
	  Serial.print(", ");
	  Serial.println(imu.gz);
	}

	void printMag()
	{
	  // To read from the magnetometer, you must first call the
	  // readMag() function. When this exits, it'll update the
	  // mx, my, and mz variables with the most current data.
	  imu.readMag();
	  
	  // Now we can use the mx, my, and mz variables as we please.
	  Serial.print("M: ");
	  Serial.print(imu.mx);
	  Serial.print(", ");
	  Serial.print(imu.my);
	  Serial.print(", ");
	  Serial.println(imu.mz);
	}
