locker-firmware and unlocker-firmware are provided as example binaries 
that will set and unset the write protection flag for the bootloader.


#WARNING!

Only load these binaries if you have an ST-Link programmer and a programming
shield, since you run the risk of overwriting your bootloader and "bricking"
your core.
